# c-p-i-o's dotfiles

This repo contains my [dotfiles](http://dotfiles.github.io/).
This is intended for me to quickly get setup in a new dev environment.
Please feel free to take inspiration or suggest changes!

## Requirements

`dotfiles` makes a series of assumptions about its environment:

* `zsh` is available as a shell at `/bin/zsh`
* Packages are preinstalled. Some of these packages are:
  * `git`
  * `aws`
  * `tmux`
  * `act`
